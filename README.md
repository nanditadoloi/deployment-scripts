# Video on Demand and ML Infra

This code-base contains scripts that have been helpful for me to work on multiple projects:

1. Video-on-Demand: I created a multi-zone video server using custom managed K8s cluster and AWS load balancers.

2. ML Training Infra: Some scripts I found helpful while setting up distributed (DDP and FSDP) training job.
